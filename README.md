Given code is raw html/css/php/js
I provided an SQL file which you can import in phpMyAdmin ( I will also update this file in the upcoming future )

## How to start Kulaba?


(UPDATE : https://kulaba.000webhostapp.com/landingPage.php
The website is now hosted. make sure to ignore the security warnings as i don't have an SSL Certificate)


If your here you probably know what a XAMPP server is. Open it and run Apache + MySql.
Go to phpMyAdmin and after clicking import, upload the .sql file.
As i'm running multiple sessions on my computer, i've changed the default port settings of 3306 to 3307. If you haven't modified your port settings in mySQL, open the dbh.inc.php file in the includes folder.
inside dbh.inc.php either completely remove the 3307 In the end or change it to 3306 (Unless your using a different port).
Same thing goes for the username and password, just check your phpMyAdmin settings.

After these steps, the website should work properly.

I'm currently busy with learning git, after that i will be learning a bit of JavaScript to create a landing page ( Not only ).
So if the website looks depressing for now, it surely has a bright future!

P.S - Looking back at this project, I wish i knew about migrations back then : - )
